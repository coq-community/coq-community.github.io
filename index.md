## About

[<img src="coq-logo.svg" align="right" width="100">](https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto)

coq-community is project for a collaborative, community-driven effort for the long-term
maintenance and advertisement of packages for the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr). The organization
is run by volunteer Coq users. Everyone is welcome - you don't need to be a very experienced
Coq user to participate.

## Project Hosting

Coq-related projects can be hosted in the [coq-community organization](https://github.com/coq-community) on GitHub
whenever any of the following is the case:

- the project has become a collective work (several community members are
  actively working on it);
- the initial author has stopped maintaining the project and someone else is
  volunteering to do so;
- the initial author is still maintaining the project but they want to
  encourage other community members to participate in the maintenance and
  possibly take over (and the project is indeed raising interest from the
  community);
- the project is a tool of general interest and it makes sense to develop it
  collaboratively.

Once a project has joined coq-community, community members collaborate to ensure:

- project packages are continuously published on Coq's [OPAM package index](https://coq.inria.fr/packages)
  and other relevant venues;
- projects use best practices for automation (e.g., building and continuous integration) as
  the project and Coq itself evolves;
- projects provide rich metadata and documentation to enable application in other projects
  and in research.
